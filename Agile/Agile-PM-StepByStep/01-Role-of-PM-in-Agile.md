# 01 â€” Role of PM in Agile

PMs enable outcomes by aligning scope, schedule, and stakeholders while respecting Scrum roles.

## Responsibilities
- Align roadmap and releases with business goals
- Facilitate cross-team planning and dependency management
- Maintain RAID log and escalate risks/issues
- Ensure governance, compliance, and budget guardrails
- Improve flow: remove systemic blockers, optimize processes

## Partnering with PO & SM
- PO: outcome ownership and backlog priorities; PM supports with planning and comms
- SM: team process and impediments; PM addresses org-level impediments

## Anti-patterns
- PM acting as Scrum Master for multiple teams long-term
- PM dictating scope/dates without negotiation
- Hidden work and side channels bypassing backlog
