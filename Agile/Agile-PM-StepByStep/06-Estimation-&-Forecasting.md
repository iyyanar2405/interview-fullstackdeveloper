# 06 — Estimation & Forecasting

Estimate for sequencing; forecast delivery dates using observed flow.

Estimation
- Relative sizing: story points; t-shirt sizes; spikes for uncertainty
- Calibrate with reference stories; avoid converting points to hours

Forecasting
- Flow metrics: cycle time, throughput, WIP
- Burn-up charts: scope vs done; focus on trends
- Monte Carlo: simple simulation using historical throughput to get P50/P85 dates

Practical
- Keep at least 20–30 historical data points
- Communicate as ranges with confidence, not single dates
- Re-forecast when scope or throughput materially changes

Artifacts: estimation reference sheet, burn-up view, MC forecast snapshot.
