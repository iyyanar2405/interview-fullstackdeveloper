# 08 â€” Budgeting & Procurement

Control costs while enabling delivery speed.

Budgeting
- Baseline: CapEx vs OpEx; labor vs non-labor
- Tracking: burn-up vs plan; EAC, ETC; variance thresholds
- Controls: approvals, change orders, contingency reserves

Procurement
- SOWs, POs, renewals; termination clauses
- Vendor selection criteria; security/compliance requirements
- Performance and penalty/bonus mechanisms

Scenario
- Cloud spend spike: PM sets budget alerts, rightsizes resources, negotiates committed use discounts; updates forecast and exec brief.
