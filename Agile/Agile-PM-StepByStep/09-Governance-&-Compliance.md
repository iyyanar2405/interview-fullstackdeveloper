# 09 â€” Governance & Compliance

Meet policy/audit needs without killing agility.

Governance
- Decision rights; steering; change control thresholds
- Quality gates: security checks, test coverage, SLOs
- Evidence: decision logs, approvals, test artifacts

Compliance
- Common regimes: SOX, GDPR, PCI, HIPAA
- Controls mapping: who provides evidence, when, where stored
- Data handling, retention, DPIAs, incident response

Scenario
- Audit request mid-release; PM gathers evidence from repo/CI/CD, security scans, decision logs; avoids freeze by proving controls.
