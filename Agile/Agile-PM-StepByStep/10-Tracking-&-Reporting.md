# 10 â€” Tracking & Reporting

Create transparency and fast feedback loops.

KPIs & views
- Delivery: throughput, cycle time, WIP, predictability (P85)
- Quality: escaped defects, flake rate, MTTR
- Product: adoption, activation, retention, NPS
- Finance: burn vs plan, unit economics

Dashboards
- Cumulative flow diagram; burn-up; defect trends
- Alerts on WIP > limit, cycle time outliers, build failures

Exec reporting
- One-page weekly; monthly steering pack; OKR progress

Scenario
- Cycle time drift detected; PM works with team to limit WIP and remove a QA bottleneck; trend normalizes in two sprints.
