# 12 â€” Resource & Team Health

Sustain delivery by protecting capacity and well-being.

Capacity
- Team calendars (PTO, holidays); sustainable pace; buffer for unplanned work
- Skill matrix; hiring/backfill plan; onboarding checklists

Team health
- Signals: burnout, carryover, after-hours spikes, PR wait time
- Agreements: working hours, meeting hygiene, definition of done, WIP limits
- Interventions: rotate on-call, focus days, pair/mob sessions, remove low-value meetings

Scenario
- On-call burnout: PM supports rotation redesign, adds compensation policy clarity, tracks MTTR and after-hours trend until stable.
