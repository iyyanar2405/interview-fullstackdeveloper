# 03 â€” User Stories & Backlog

## User stories (INVEST)
- Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable

## Template
As a <user>, I want <capability> so that <benefit>.

## Acceptance criteria (Gherkin)
```gherkin
Given I am a logged-in user
When I add an item to the cart
Then I see the updated cart total
```

## Backlog management
- Prioritization: MoSCoW, WSJF
- Refinement: slice large epics into stories
- Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD)

Anti-patterns: solution-led stories, massive stories, hidden work.
