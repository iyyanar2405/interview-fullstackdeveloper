# 04 — Estimation & Planning

## Estimation
- Story Points ≠ hours; relative complexity and effort
- Planning Poker with Fibonacci (1,2,3,5,8,13,...)

## Capacity planning
- Team capacity = (team members x focus factor) x sprint days
- Account for holidays/support work

## Sprint planning
- Select backlog items to meet a Sprint Goal
- Break into tasks (ideally < 1 day each)
- Identify risks/dependencies; set WIP limits

Calibration tip: keep a benchmark story for reference.
