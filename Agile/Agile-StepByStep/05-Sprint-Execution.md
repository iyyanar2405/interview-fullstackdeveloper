# 05 — Sprint Execution

## Daily flow
- Update board; pull tasks; limit WIP
- Raise impediments early; swarm on blockers

## DoD and quality gates
- Code review, tests green, lint, security checks, docs updated

## Handling bugs
- Triage quickly; label sev/priority; reserve capacity for critical fixes

## Board workflow
To Do → In Progress → In Review → Testing → Done

Tip: keep tasks small and vertical (end-to-end slices).
