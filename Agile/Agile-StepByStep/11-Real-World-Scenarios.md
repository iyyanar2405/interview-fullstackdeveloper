# 11 â€” Real-world Scenarios

Concrete situations and how to handle them.

## 1) Production incident mid-sprint
- Stop and swarm; create incident bridge; assign roles (comms, driver, scribe)
- Patch fix with feature flag; create follow-up RCAs and action items

## 2) Scope creep after planning
- Reaffirm Sprint Goal; negotiate trade-offs; move non-critical stories to next sprint
- Capture change as a new story; avoid invisible scope

## 3) External dependency blocker
- Elevate early; define SLA with external team; decouple via adapters/mocks
- Re-plan sprint; pull alternatives to keep momentum

## 4) Hard deadline (regulatory)
- Slice by compliance risk; short sprints; daily risk review
- Add dark-launch and toggle strategies; cut nice-to-haves

## 5) Team capacity drop
- Recalculate capacity; reduce WIP; focus on highest value items; update stakeholders
