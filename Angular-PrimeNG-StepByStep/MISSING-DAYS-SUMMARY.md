## üìù Quick Action Plan

Would you like me to:

1. **Complete Foundation (Days 07-10)** - 4 comprehensive lessons
2. **Create ALL PrimeNG Basics (Days 12-20)** - 9 component lessons  
3. **Generate project templates for Days 41-50** - Structured projects
4. **Create summary/cheat sheet versions** - Faster to generate
5. **Focus on specific topics you need most** - Tell me which days

Each comprehensive lesson takes ~700-1000 lines. I can create:
- **Full detailed lessons** (like Days 01-06) - slower but thorough
- **Structured outlines** with code examples - faster coverage
- **Hybrid approach** - detailed for key days, outlines for others

I recommend creating in batches:
- **Batch 1:** Days 07-10 (Foundation) - DETAILED
- **Batch 2:** Days 12-20 (PrimeNG Basics) - DETAILED
- **Batch 3:** Days 21-30 (Advanced Components) - STRUCTURED
- **Batch 4:** Days 31-40 (Forms) - STRUCTURED
- **Batch 5:** Days 41-50 (Projects) - PROJECT TEMPLATES
- **Batch 6:** Days 51-60 (Expert) - ADVANCED TOPICS

**All set! Want me to add runnable sample projects or code sandboxes next?** üöÄ
