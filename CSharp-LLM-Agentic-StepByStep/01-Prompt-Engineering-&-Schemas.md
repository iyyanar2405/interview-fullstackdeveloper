# 01 — Prompt Engineering & Schemas (Day 4–6)

Goal: Shape outputs with a schema and tighten the system prompt.

Steps
1) Open `Program.cs` and find `SystemPrompt` in `SimpleAgent`
2) Add an instruction: "Respond as JSON: { answer, sources }"
3) Ask a question; observe output (echo/openai/anthropic)
4) Record good/bad prompts and refine wording

Artifacts
- Before/after prompt
- 3 examples of outputs following the schema
