# 06 — RAG Retrieval & Re-ranking (Day 19–21)

Goal: Improve relevance with reranking or embeddings.

Steps
1) Implement simple overlap-score rerank of top-5 to top-2
2) Optional: call provider embeddings (if available) to compute cosine
3) Compare answers with and without rerank/embeddings

Artifacts
- Before/after answers
- Short note on impact to relevance
