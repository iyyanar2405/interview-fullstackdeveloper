# 90-Day Camera Operator / DP Communication Fluency (Step-by-Step)

Practical, daily plan to sharpen camera operator/DP communication across pre-production, production, and post: lens/language, look references, lighting plans, crew comms, safety, camera reports, dailies notes, color/LUT/CDL briefs, and reel/EPK deliverables.

## Outcomes by Day 90
- Clear, consistent look language (composition, movement, exposure)
- Production-ready camera sheets, lighting plans, and safety briefs
- Effective on-set comms with ADs, G&E, Sound, Script Sup, and Director
- Tight post briefs for color and dailies; handoffs to editorial
- Portfolio: 20+ camera artifacts, 2–3 decks, reel + EPK

## Structure & cadence
- 13 weeks × 7 days (~90 days), 30–60 minutes/day
- Weekly themes mapped to real production phases with daily micro-tasks
- Milestones at Day 30/60/90 with check-ins and review rubrics

## How to use
- Create an Artifacts/ folder; save deliverables by week/day
- Use Templates-&-Checklists.md for structure
- Track in Tracking-Workbook.md (5-point rubric)
