# 00 — Orientation, Setup & Complexity (Days 1–7)

Goal: Set up Python tooling, refresh Big-O, and create a solution scaffold.

Day 1: Setup
- Install Python 3.11+, pipx, virtualenv; choose editor (VS Code)
- Artifact: `Artifacts/00/setup-notes.md`

Day 2: Complexity refresher
- Big-O for common ops; arrays, sets, dicts in Python
- Artifact: Cheatsheet with examples

Day 3: Solution scaffold
- Pattern: read → solve() → tests; stdin/stdout patterns
- Artifact: `template.py` with parse + solve + tests structure

Day 4: Testing harness
- PyTest basics; parametrize; quick benchmarks (timeit)
- Artifact: `tests/` folder seed and `pytest.ini`

Day 5: Edge cases
- Empty, large inputs, invalid, timeouts
- Artifact: Edge-case checklist

Day 6: Review + drill
- 3 warm-up problems (two sum, valid anagram, reverse string)
- Artifact: Notes with complexities

Day 7: Retro
- What slowed you down? Improve scaffold and notes
- Artifact: Change log
