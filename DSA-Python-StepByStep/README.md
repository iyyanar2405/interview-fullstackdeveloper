# DSA in Python — Step by Step (14-Week Plan)

A practical, interview-ready path to master Data Structures & Algorithms in Python, with daily micro-tasks, examples, and practice problems.

## Outcomes by Week 14
- Fluency with core data structures and patterns
- Ability to estimate time/space complexity quickly
- Pattern-first problem solving (sliding window, two pointers, DP)
- Portfolio of solved problems with explanations and tests

## Cadence
- 14 weeks × 7 days (~90 days), 45–75 minutes/day
- Each chapter: Learn → Implement → Practice → Reflect

## How to use
- Save your code and notes in Artifacts/ by chapter/day
- Reuse Templates-&-Checklists.md for solution scaffolds
- Track your progress in Tracking-Workbook.md
