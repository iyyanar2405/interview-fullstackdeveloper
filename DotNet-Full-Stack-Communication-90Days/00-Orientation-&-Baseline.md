Day 2: Working agreements
- Branching, commit messages, PR reviews, definition of done
- Artifact: Team working agreement one-pager

Day 3: Baseline status update
- 250–300 words: sprint status, risks, next steps
- Artifact: Email/Slack update (before/after edited)

Day 4: Docs structure
- Decide on docs repo structure: /docs, ADRs in /adr, templates
- Artifact: Docs README + index

Day 5: Stakeholder map
- Product, design, QA, support, legal, compliance
- Artifact: RACI + escalation tree

Day 6: Risk register
- Top 10 risks: env drift, flaky tests, perf hotspots, auth bugs
- Artifact: RAID log (Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies)

Day 7: Retro
- What’s clear vs muddy; next-week focus
- Artifact: Self-score (clarity, completeness, timeliness, tone, follow-through)
