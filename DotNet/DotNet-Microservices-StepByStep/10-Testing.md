# 10 â€” Testing

From unit tests to end-to-end flows behind the gateway.

## Unit & integration
- Unit test pure logic
- Integration tests for HTTP handlers and persistence

## Contract tests
- Verify REST contracts (OpenAPI) and DTOs
- Backward-compatibility checks on APIs

## E2E tests
- Start services + gateway (Testcontainers/Docker compose)
- Exercise user journeys via gateway endpoints

Next: Containerization and Kubernetes.
