# 00 — Orientation & Baseline (Day 0)

Set up tools, capture a baseline, and learn how you’ll measure progress.

## Setup
- Create `Artifacts/` with subfolders Week01..Week13
- Install: Grammarly/LanguageTool, Hemingway Editor, Notion/Obsidian (or Markdown), a voice recorder app
- Create your Vocabulary deck (Anki/Quizlet) with 0 cards

## Baseline diagnostics (save outputs in Artifacts/Week00)
- Writing (30 min): Write a 300–400 word status email to execs for a fictional release delay; no tools or prompts
- Speaking (10 min): Record a 2-min standup update (yesterday/today/risks)
- Technical (20 min): Draft a JIRA ticket for a bug fix (description, steps, expected/actual, acceptance)

## Rubric (5 = excellent, 1 = needs work)
- Clarity: 1–5
- Concision: 1–5
- Structure: 1–5
- Tone & professionalism: 1–5
- Grammar & mechanics: 1–5

## Plan your schedule
- Daily 45–60 mins: 25 mins practice + 15 mins review + 10 mins vocab
- Set calendar reminders; define a backup slot

Outcome: Tools configured, baseline artifacts captured, and target schedule blocked.
