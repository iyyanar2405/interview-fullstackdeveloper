# 01 â€” Foundations: Clarity & Grammar (Week 1)

Theme: Write simply. One idea per sentence. Prefer active voice. Avoid filler.

Daily plan
- Day 1: Short sentences practice (rewrite 5 long sentences from your codebase/docs)
- Day 2: Active vs passive voice drills (convert 10 passive to active)
- Day 3: Parallel structure and list hygiene (rewrite 3 messy lists)
- Day 4: Grammar basics: subject-verb agreement; articles (a/an/the) in tech contexts
- Day 5: Punctuation basics: commas, colons, bullets; sentence fragments
- Day 6: Micro-essay (200 words) explaining a bug RCA to a non-technical stakeholder
- Day 7: Weekly review; compile best-before/after examples

Deliverables
- 10 rewritten sentences; 3 improved lists; 1 micro-essay
- Add 15 vocabulary cards (clarify, mitigate, backlog, deprecate, escalate, etc.)
