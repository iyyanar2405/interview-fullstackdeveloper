# 90-Day Film Director Communication Fluency (Step-by-Step)

Practical, daily plan to sharpen a director’s communication across pre-production, production, and post: vision pitches, breakdowns, call sheets, on-set comms, dailies notes, editorial briefs, and festival/EPK deliverables.

## Outcomes by Day 90
- Clear, concise direction notes; consistent vision language across departments
- Production-ready schedules, call sheets, safety briefs, and scout reports
- Effective on-set communication protocols with ADs and department heads
- Tight post-production briefs: editor/sound/VFX/color with actionable notes
- Portfolio: 20+ production artifacts, 2–3 decks, EPK + submission pack
