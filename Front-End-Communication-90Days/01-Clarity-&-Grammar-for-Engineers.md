# 01 — Clarity & Grammar for Engineers (Days 8–14)

Goal: Write crisp, actionable frontend updates.

Daily drills:
- Use imperative voice and concrete nouns; avoid vague UX copy
- Use tables for props, events, and states
- Structure: Context → Decision → Action → CTA

Deliverables by day:
- D8: Rewrite 2 long updates into 5 bullets + CTA
- D9: PR description template + 5 examples
- D10: Commit message conventions + samples
- D11: Standup stems (yesterday/today/risks/needs)
- D12: Meeting notes template (decisions/actions/owners/dates)
- D13: Review comments stems (kind, specific, actionable)
- D14: Retro with before/after examples
