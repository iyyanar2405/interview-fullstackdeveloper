# 90-Day Music Director Communication Fluency (Step-by-Step)

Practical, daily plan to sharpen a music director’s communication across pre-production, recording, and release: creative briefs, references, charts, session plans, studio comms, mix/master notes, and release/EPK deliverables.

## Outcomes by Day 90
- Clear creative direction across artists, musicians, producers, and engineers
- Production-ready charts, schedules, call sheets, safety/tech briefs
- Effective studio communication: takes notes, comping, revision passes
- Tight mix/master briefs with timecoded, actionable feedback
- Portfolio: 20+ production artifacts, 2–3 decks, EPK + release pack

## Structure & cadence
- 13 weeks × 7 days (~90 days), 30–60 minutes/day

- Milestones at Day 30/60/90 with check-ins and review rubrics

## How to use
