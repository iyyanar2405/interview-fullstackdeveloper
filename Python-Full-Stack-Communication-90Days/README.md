# 90-Day Python Full Stack Communication Fluency (Step-by-Step)

Practical daily plan to level up engineering communication across requirements, architecture, API/data design (FastAPI/Django), frontend integration, DevOps, security, quality, and stakeholder updates—grounded in Python real-world scenarios.

## Outcomes by Day 90
- Clear requirements/user stories and acceptance criteria
- Solid architecture docs and ADRs for Python APIs + frontend
- Clean API specs (OpenAPI), versioning, and change control
- Deploy-ready CI/CD comms with traceable release notes
- Actionable incident updates, postmortems, and stakeholder comms
- Portfolio: 20–30 artifacts and 2–3 short decks

## Cadence
- 13 weeks × 7 days (~90 days), 30–60 minutes/day
- Weekly theme + focused daily artifacts; milestone reviews at 30/60/90

## How to use
- Save outputs in Artifacts/ by week/day
- Reuse structures from Templates-&-Checklists.md
- Score weekly in Tracking-Workbook.md (5-point rubric)
