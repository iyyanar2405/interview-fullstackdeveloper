# 00 — Orientation & Baseline (Days 1–7)

Goal: Set up your workspace, communication channels, and capture a baseline of writing samples and coaching artifacts.

Day 1: Setup
- Create folders: Artifacts/Week00, Video/, Data/
- Tools checklist: timing app, spreadsheets, shared drive, messaging platform
- Write: "Coaching Principles" one-pager (audience: athletes & parents)

Day 2: Baseline writing sample
- Write a 200–300 word update: season overview, expectations, safety
- Artifact: Email draft to parents (save as Week00/parent-intro.md)

Day 3: Athlete intake
- Build a simple form (age, events, goals, injuries)
- Artifact: Intake template + comms blurb to athletes

Day 4: Facility & safety
- Document pool rules, lifeguard contact, emergency action plan (EAP)
- Artifact: Safety brief v1 for first practice

Day 5: Practice audit
- Observe or recall a session; note clarity of cues, set formatting
- Artifact: Practice set sheet (with lane assignments, intervals)

Day 6: Data baseline
- Choose 1–2 test sets (e.g., 10×100 FR @1:30, descend 1–5, 6–10)
- Artifact: Data sheet structure (splits, RPE, stroke rate)

Day 7: Retrospective
- What communication felt clear/unclear? Risks next week?
- Artifact: 5-point self-rating rubric (clarity, safety, actionability, tone, follow-through)
